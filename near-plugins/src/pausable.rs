//! # Pausable:
//!
//! Trait which allows contracts to implement an emergency stop mechanism that can be triggered
//! by an authorized account. This authorized account can pause certain features which will
//! prevent some methods or behaviors to be executed. It is expected as well that some methods
//! only work in case certain feature is paused, this will be useful to implement escape hatches.
//!
//! Features are identified by keys.
//!
//! ## Default implementation:
//!
//! Key "ALL" is understood to pause all "pausable" features at once.
//! Provided implementation is optimized for the case where only a small amount of features are
//! paused at a single moment. If all features are meant to be paused, use "ALL" instead. This is done
//! by storing all paused keys in a single slot on the storage. Notice that unpausing "ALL" will not
//! necessarily unpause all features, if other features are still present in the paused_list.
//!
//! As a precondition for being `Pausable` a contract must be `AccessControllable`. Access control
//! is used to define the permissions required to pause and unpause features. In addition, grantees
//! of access control roles may be allowed to call methods that are `#[pause]` or `#[if_paused]`
//! unrestrictedly via the `except` argument.
//!
//! ## Credits:
//!
//! Inspired by Open Zeppelin Pausable module:
