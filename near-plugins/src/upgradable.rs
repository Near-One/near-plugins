//! # Upgradable:
//!
//! Upgradable implementation inspired by [NEP123](https://github.com/near/NEPs/pull/123).
//!
//! To upgrade the contract, first the code needs to be staged, and then it can be deployed.
//!
//! ## Default implementation:
//!
//! Only owner or self can call `stage_code` and `deploy_code`.
//! There is no timer or staging duration implemented by default.
//!
//! ## Security concerns:
//!
//! Only authorized account is allowed to call `stage_code` and `deploy_code`. There may be several
//! reasons to protect `deploy_code`. One such reason to keep in mind, is when the code is upgraded
//! in such a way that requires some sort of migration or initialization. In that case, it is
//! recommended to run a batched transaction where `deploy_code` is called first, and then a
//! function that executes the migration or initialization.
//!
//! After the code is deployed, it should be removed from staging. This will prevent an old code
//! with a security vulnerability to be deployed, in case it was upgraded using other mechanism.
