//! # Upgradable
//!
//! Upgradable trait inspired by [NEP123](https://github.com/near/NEPs/pull/123).
//!
//! Using the `Upgradable` plugin requires a contract to be `AccessControllable`.
//!
//! To upgrade the contract, first the code needs to be staged via [`Upgradable::up_stage_code`].
//! Staged code can then be deployed by calling [`Upgradable::up_deploy_code`]. Optionally a staging
//! duration can be set, which defines the minimum duration that must pass before staged code can be
//! deployed.
//!
//! The staging duration defaults to zero, allowing staged code to be deployed immediately. To set a
//! staging duration, call [`Upgradable::up_init_staging_duration`]. After initialization the
//! staging duration can be updated by calling [`Upgradable::up_stage_update_staging_duration`]
//! followed by [`Upgradable::up_apply_update_staging_duration`]. Updating the staging duration is
//! itself subject to a delay: at least the currently set staging duration must pass before a staged
//! update can be applied.
//!
//! ## Permissions
//!
//! The `Upgradable` methods mentioned above are protected by `AccessControllable`. Only accounts
//! that have been granted one of the whitelisted roles may successfully call the corresponding
//! method. The documentation of these methods and the [example contract] explain how to define and
//! whitelist roles to manage authorization for the `Upgradable` plugin.
//!
//! ## State migration
//!
//! Upgrading a contract might require [state migration]. The `Upgradable` plugin allows to attach a
//! function call to code deployments. Using this mechanism, state migration can be carried out by
//! calling a migration function. If the function fails, the deployment is rolled back and the
//! initial code remains active. More detailed information is available in the documentation of
//! [`Upgradable::up_deploy_code`].
//!
//! ## Stale staged code
//!
//! After the code is deployed, it should be removed from staging. This will prevent old code with a
//! security vulnerability to be deployed.
//!
//! ## Upgrading code that contains a security vulnerability
//!
//! Once code is staged for an upgrade, it is publicly visible via [`Upgradable::up_staged_code`].
//! Staged code that fixes a security vulnerability might be discovered by an attacker who then
//! exploits the vulnerability before its fix is deployed.
//!
//! To avoid that, the upgrade can be executed by calling [`Upgradable::up_stage_code`] and
//! [`Upgradable::up_deploy_code`] in a [batch transaction] in case no staging duration is set.
//! Since [`Upgradable::up_deploy_code`] returns a promise that ultimately deploys the new contract
//! code, a theoretical risk remains. However, the [time between scheduling and execution] of a
//! promise hardly allows an attacker to exploit a vulnerability: they would have to retrieve the
//! bytes of the staged code, reverse engineer the new contract, build an exploit and finally
//! execute it. Therefore, we consider that risk of an exploit in case of a batched upgrade
//! negligible.
//!
//! Another defense mechanism is staging encrypted code, though this requires your own
//! implementation of the trait `Upgradable`. The default implementation provided by
//! `near-plugins-derive` does not support it.
