//! # Upgradable
//!
//! Upgradable trait inspired by [NEP123](https://github.com/near/NEPs/pull/123).
//!
//! To upgrade the contract, first the code needs to be staged, and then it can be deployed.
//!
//! ## Default implementation
//!
//! Only owner or self can call [`Upgradable::up_stage_code`] and [`Upgradable::up_deploy_code`].
//!
//! There is no timer or staging duration implemented by default.
//!
//! ## Permissions
//!
//! Only an authorized account is allowed to call [`Upgradable::up_stage_code`] and
//! [`Upgradable::up_deploy_code`]. There may be several reasons to protect `deploy_code`. For
//! example if an upgrade requires migration or initialization. In that case, it is recommended to
//! run a batched transaction where [`Upgradable::up_deploy_code`] is called first, and then a
//! function that executes the migration or initialization.
//!
//! ## Stale staged code
//!
//! After the code is deployed, it should be removed from staging. This will prevent old code with a
//! security vulnerability to be deployed.
//!
//! ## Upgrading code that contains a security vulnerability
//!
//! Once code is staged for an upgrade, it is publicly visible via [`Upgradable::up_staged_code`].
//! Staged code that fixes a security vulnerability might be discovered by an attacker who then
//! exploits the vulnerability before its fix is deployed.
//!
//! To avoid that, the upgrade can be executed by calling [`Upgradable::up_stage_code`] and
//! [`Upgradable::up_deploy_code`] in a [batch transaction]. Since [`Upgradable::up_deploy_code`]
//! returns a promise that ultimately deploys the new contract code, a theoretical risk remains.
//! However, the [time between scheduling and execution] of a promise hardly allows an attacker to
//! exploit a vulnerability: they would have to retrieve the bytes of the staged code, reverse
//! engineer the new contract, build an exploit and finally execute it. Therefore, we consider that
//! risk of an exploit in case of a batched upgrade negligible.
//!
//! Another defense mechanism is staging encrypted code, though this requires your own
//! implementation of the trait `Upgradable`. The default implementation provided by
//! `near-plugins-derive` does not support it.
//!
