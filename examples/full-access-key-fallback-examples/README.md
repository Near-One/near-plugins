# Example of using Full Access Key Fallback plugin

Allows an authorized account to attach a Full Access Key to the contract.

Contract example using Full Access Key Fallback plugin. Note that it requires the contract to be Ownable.

```rust
use near_plugins::{Ownable, FullAccessKeyFallback};
use near_sdk::near_bindgen;
use near_plugins_derive::only;
use borsh::{BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize};

#[near_bindgen]
#[derive(Ownable, FullAccessKeyFallback, Default, BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize)]
struct Counter {
  counter: u64,
}

#[near_bindgen]
impl Counter {
  /// Specify the owner of the contract in the constructor
  #[init]
  pub fn new() -> Self {
      let mut contract = Self { counter: 0 };
      contract.owner_set(Some(near_sdk::env::predecessor_account_id()));
      contract
  }

  /// *Only* self account can call this method. This can be used even if the contract is not Ownable.
  #[only(self)]
  pub fn protected_self(&mut self) {
      self.counter += 1;
  }

  pub fn get_counter(&self) -> u64 {
      self.counter
  }
}
```

## The contract methods description
### attach_full_access_key
`attach_full_access_key` is a method that attaches new full access for the current account.
Only the owner of the contract can use this function.

```shell
near call <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT> attach_full_access_key '{"public_key": "ed25519:ErVTCTvmepb4NDhQ7infTomkLVsd1iTWwLR84FBhV7UC"}' --accountId <OWNER_ACCOUNT>
```

If the method succeeds, the following event will be emitted:
```json
{
   "standard":"FullAccessKeyFallback",
   "version":"1.0.0",
   "event":"full_access_key_added",
   "data": {
      "by":"<OWNER_ACCOUNT>",
      "public_key":"ed25519:ErVTCTvmepb4NDhQ7infTomkLVsd1iTWwLR84FBhV7UC"
   }
}
```

## Preparation steps for demonstration
In that document, we are providing some examples of using a contract with a full access key fallback plugin. You also can explore the usage examples in the tests in `./full_access_key_fallback_base/src/lib.rs`. For running tests, please take a look at the **Test running instruction** section.

1. **Creating an account on testnet**
   For demonstration let's create 2 accounts: `<CONTRACT_ACCOUNT>`, `<ALICE_ACCOUNT>`
   ```shell
   $ near create-account <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT_NAME>.<MASTER_ACCOUNT_NAME>.testnet --masterAccount <MASTER_ACCOUNT_NAME>.testnet --initialBalance 10
   $ near create-account <ALICE_ACCOUNT_NAME>.<MASTER_ACCOUNT_NAME>.testnet --masterAccount <MASTER_ACCOUNT_NAME>.testnet --initialBalance 10
   ```

   In the next section we will refer to the `<CONTRACT_ACCOUNT_NAME>.<MASTER_ACCOUNT_NAME>.testnet` as `<CONTRACT_ACCOUNT>`,
   to the `<ALICE_ACCOUNT_NAME>.<MASTER_ACCOUNT_NAME>.testnet` as `<ALICE_ACCOUNT>`.

2. **Compile Contract to wasm file**
   For compiling the contract just run the `full_access_key_fallback_base/build.sh` script. The target file with compiled contract will be `../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/full_access_key_fallback_base.wasm`

   ```shell
   $ cd full_access_key_fallback_base
   $ ./build.sh
   $ cd ..
   ```

3. **Deploy and init a contract**
   ```shell
   $ near deploy --accountId <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT> --wasmFile ../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/full_access_key_fallback_base.wasm --initFunction new --initArgs '{}'
   ```

## Example of using the contract with full access key fallback plugin
Our plan for this example is to remove the full access key and after that bring it back.
The keys usually storage at `$HOME/.near-credentials/testnet/<CONTRACT_ACCOUNT>.json`. Also let's
choose some operations that only the contract with a full access key can do, for example,
money transfer.

Moving ownership rights to the Alice account. 
```shell
$ near call <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT> owner_set '{"owner": "<ALICE_ACCOUNT>"}' --accountId <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT>
```

Checking that currently we can transfer the money for example to Alice account
```shell
$ near send <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT> <ALICE_ACCOUNT> 1
```

Removing the full access key for contract account
```shell
$ near delete-key <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT> "ed25519:ErVTCTvmepb4NDhQ7infTomkLVsd1iTWwLR84FBhV7UC"
```
The value of public-key can be found at `$HOME/.near-credentials/testnet/<CONTRACT_ACCOUNT>.json`. 

Checking, that now the money transfer will not work: 
```shell
$ near send <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT> <ALICE_ACCOUNT> 1
ERROR
```

Adding the key back and check that it will work
```shell
$ near call <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT> attach_full_access_key '{"public_key": "ed25519:ErVTCTvmepb4NDhQ7infTomkLVsd1iTWwLR84FBhV7UC"}' --accountId <ALICE_ACCOUNT>
$ near send <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT> <ALICE_ACCOUNT> 1
```

## Tests running instruction
Tests in `full_access_key_fallback_base/src/lib.rs` contain examples of interaction with a contract.

For running test:
1. Generate `wasm` file by running `build.sh` script. The target file will be `../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/full_access_key_fallback_base.wasm`
2. Run tests `cargo test`

```shell
$ cd full_access_key_fallback_base
$ ./build.sh
$ cargo test
```

For tests, we use `workspaces` library and `sandbox` environment. For details, you can explore `../near-plugins-test-utils` crate.
