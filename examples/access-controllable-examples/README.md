# Example of using the Access Control plugin

An access control mechanism that allows you to specify which groups of users can access certain functions.

```rust
use near_plugins::AccessControllable;
use near_plugins::AccessControlRole;
use near_plugins_derive::access_control;
use near_plugins_derive::access_control_any;
use near_sdk::near_bindgen;
use borsh::{BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize};
use near_sdk::env;

/// All types of access groups
#[derive(AccessControlRole, Clone, Copy)]
pub enum UsersGroups {
   GroupA,
   GroupB,
}

#[near_bindgen]
#[access_control(role_type(UsersGroups))]
#[derive(Default, BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize)]
struct Counter {
   counter: u64,
}

#[near_bindgen]
impl Counter {
   /// In the constructor we set up a super admin,
   /// which can control the member lists of all user groups
   #[init]
   pub fn new() -> Self {
      let mut contract: Counter = Self{
         counter: 0,
         __acl: __Acl::default(),
      };

      contract.acl_init_super_admin(near_sdk::env::predecessor_account_id());

      contract
   }

   /// unprotected function, every one can call this function
   pub fn unprotected(&mut self) {
      self.counter += 1;
   }

   /// only the users from GroupA can call this method
   #[access_control_any(roles(UsersGroups::GroupA))]
   pub fn level_a_incr(&mut self) {
      self.counter += 1;
   }

   /// only the users from GroupA or GroupB can call this method
   #[access_control_any(roles(UsersGroups::GroupA, UsersGroups::GroupB))]
   pub fn level_ab_incr(&mut self) {
      self.counter += 1;
   }


   /// view method for get current counter value, every one can use it
   pub fn get_counter(&self) -> u64 {
      self.counter
   }
}
```

## The contract methods description
### acl_storage_prefix
`acl_storage_prefix` is a method that returns the common prefix of keys for storing the members and the admins of groups.
`__acl` by default.

```shell
$ near call <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT> acl_storage_prefix --accountId <ALICE_ACCOUNT>
Scheduling a call: <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT>.acl_storage_prefix()
Doing account.functionCall()
Transaction Id <TRANSACTION_ID>
To see the transaction in the transaction explorer, please open this url in your browser
https://explorer.testnet.near.org/transactions/<TRANSACTION_ID>
[ 95, 95, 97, 99, 108 ]
$ python3
>>> print(' '.join(str(b) for b in bytes("__acl", 'utf8')))
95 95 97 99 108
```

Example of changing acl storage prefix key:
```rust
#[near_bindgen]
#[access_control(role_type(UsersGroups), storage_prefix = "__custom_prefix")]
#[derive(Default, BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize)]
struct Counter {
  counter: u64,
}
```

### acl_init_super_admin
`acl_init_super_admin` is a method that adds `account_id` as a super-admin _without_ checking any permissions
in case there are no super-admins. Do nothing if at least one super-admin exists. This function can be used to add a super-admin during contract initialization. 
Moreover, it may provide a recovery mechanism if (mistakenly) all super-admins have been removed. 

**Return value:** the return value indicates whether `account_id` was added as super-admin.

It is `#[private]` in the implementation provided by this trait, i.e. only the contract itself may call this method.

```shell
$ near call <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT> acl_init_super_admin '{"account_id": "<SUPER_ADMIN_ACCOUNT>"}' --accountId <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT>
true
```

If the method succeeds, the following event will be emitted:
```json
{
   "standard":"AccessControllable",
   "version":"1.0.0",
   "event":"super_admin_added",
   "data":{
      "account":"<SUPER_ADMIN_ACCOUNT>",
      "by":"<CONTRACT_ACCOUNT>"
   }
}
```

### acl_is_super_admin
`acl_is_super_admin` is a _view_ method that checks that account has super admin rights.
Super admin can control the member list of each group and control the admin list for each group.

```shell
$ near view <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT> acl_is_super_admin '{"account_id": "<SUPER_ADMIN_ACCOUNT>" }' 
View call: <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT>.acl_is_super_admin({"account_id": "<SUPER_ADMIN_ACCOUNT>"})
true
```

### acl_add_admin
`acl_add_admin` is a method that adds a new admin for a specific group.
Admins' rights don't allow running group-specific functions, but group admins can control the group member list.
This method can be run by an admin of a specific group or by a super admin.

**Return value:** in case of sufficient permissions, the returned `Some(bool)` indicates
whether `account_id` is a new admin for `role`. Without permissions,
`None` is returned and internal state is not modified.

```shell
$ near call <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT> acl_add_admin '{"role": "GroupA", "account_id": "<ALICE_ACCOUNT>"}' --accountId <GROUP_A_ADMIN_ACCOUNT>
true
```

If the method succeeds, the following event will be emitted:
```json
{
   "standard":"AccessControllable",
   "version":"1.0.0",
   "event":"admin_added",
   "data": {
      "role":"GroupA",
      "account":"<ALICE_ACCOUNT>",
      "by":"<GROUP_A_ADMIN_ACCOUNT>"
   }
}
```

### acl_is_admin
`acl_is_admin` is a _view_ method that checks if the account has an admin right for the specified group. For super admin, it will return true for every group.

```shell
$ near view <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT> acl_is_admin '{"role": "GroupA", "account_id": "<ALICE_ACCOUNT>"}'
View call: <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT>.acl_is_admin({"role": "GroupA", "account_id": "<ALICE_ACCOUNT>"})
true
```

### acl_revoke_admin
`acl_revoke_admin` is a method that removes the group admin right for a specific account. Can be executed by an admin of this group or by a super admin.

**Return value:** in case of sufficient permissions, the returned `Some(bool)` indicates
whether `account_id` was an admin for `role`. Without permissions,
`None` is returned and internal state is not modified.

```shell
$ near call <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT> acl_revoke_admin '{"role": "GroupA", "account_id": "<ALICE_ACCOUNT>"}' --accountId <GROUP_A_ADMIN_ACCOUNT>
true
```

If the method succeeds, the following event will be emitted:
```json
{
   "standard":"AccessControllable",
   "version":"1.0.0",
   "event":"admin_revoked",
   "data":{
      "role":"GroupA",
      "account":"<ALICE_ACCOUNT>",
      "by":"<GROUP_A_ADMIN_ACCOUNT>"
   }
}
```

### acl_renounce_admin
`acl_renounce_admin` is a method that removes the group admin right for an account that calls the method.

**Return value:** returns whether the predecessor was an admin for `role`.

```shell
$ near call <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT> acl_renounce_admin '{"role": "GroupA"}' --accountId <ALICE_ACCOUNT>
true
```

After calling that method, Alice will not have the admin right for GroupA anymore.

If the method succeeds, the following event will be emitted:
```json
{
   "standard":"AccessControllable",
   "version":"1.0.0",
   "event":"admin_revoked",
   "data":{
      "role":"GroupA",
      "account":"<ALICE_ACCOUNT>",
      "by":"<ALICE_ACCOUNT>"
   }
}
```
### acl_revoke_role
`acl_revoke_role` is a method that removes the specified account from the list of the group members.
Only a group admin or a super admin can execute this function.

**Return value:** in case of sufficient permissions, the returned `Some(bool)` indicates
whether `account_id` was a grantee of `role`. Without permissions,
`None` is returned and internal state is not modified.

```shell
$ near call <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT> acl_revoke_role '{"role": "GroupA", "account_id": "<ALICE_ACCOUNT>"}' --accountId <GROUP_A_ADMIN_ACCOUNT>
true
```

If the method succeeds, the following event will be emitted:
```json
{
   "standard":"AccessControllable",
   "version":"1.0.0",
   "event":"role_revoked",
   "data": {
      "role":"GroupA",
      "from":"<ALICE_ACCOUNT>",
      "by":"<GROUP_A_ADMIN_ACCOUNT>"
   }
}
```

### acl_renounce_role
`acl_renounce_role` is a method that removes the caller account from the member list of the group. Can be called by anyone.

**Return value:** returns whether it was a grantee of `role`.

```shell
$ near call <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT> acl_renounce_role '{"role": "GroupA"}' --accountId <ALICE_ACCOUNT>
true
```

If the method succeeds, the following event will be emitted:
```json
{
   "standard":"AccessControllable",
   "version":"1.0.0",
   "event":"role_revoked",
   "data": {
      "role":"GroupA",
      "from":"<ALICE_ACCOUNT>",
      "by":"<ALICE_ACCOUNT>"
   }
}
```
### acl_grant_role
`acl_grant_role` is a method that adds the account to the group member list. Can be executed only by a group admin or by a super admin.

**Return value:** in case of sufficient permissions, the returned `Some(bool)` indicates
whether `account_id` is a new grantee of `role`. Without permissions,
`None` is returned and internal state is not modified.

```shell
$ near call <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT> acl_grant_role '{"role": "GroupA", "account_id": "<ALICE_ACCOUNT>"}' --accountId <GROUP_A_ADMIN_ACCOUNT>
true
```

If the method succeeds, the following event will be emitted:
```json
{
   "standard":"AccessControllable",
   "version":"1.0.0",
   "event":"role_granted",
   "data": {
      "role":"GroupA",
      "to":"<ALICE_ACCOUNT>",
      "by":"<GROUP_A_ADMIN_ACCOUNT>"
   }
}
```

### acl_has_role
`acl_has_role` is a _view_ method for checking if the account is a member of the specified group.

```shell
$ near view <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT> acl_has_role '{"role": "GroupA", "account_id": "<ALICE_ACCOUNT>"}'
View call: <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT>.acl_has_role({"role": "GroupA", "account_id": "<ALICE_ACCOUNT>"})
true
```

### acl_has_any_role
`acl_has_any_role` is a _view_ method for checking if an account is a member of at least one of the specified groups.

```shell
$ near view <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT> acl_has_any_role '{"roles": ["GroupA", "GroupB"], "account_id": "<ALICE_ACCOUNT>"}'
View call: <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT>.acl_has_any_role({"roles": ["GroupA", "GroupB"], "account_id": "<ALICE_ACCOUNT>"})
true
```

### acl_get_super_admins
`acl_get_super_admins` is a _view_ method that shows some super admins. It will skip first `skip` admins and return not more than `limit` number of super admins.

```shell
$ near view <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT> acl_get_super_admins '{"skip": 0, "limit": 2}'
View call: <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT>.acl_get_super_admins({"skip": 0, "limit": 2})
[ '<CONTRACT_ACCOUNT>' ]
```

### acl_get_admins

View call: <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT>.acl_get_grantess({"role": "GroupA", "skip": 0, "limit": 2})
[ '<ALICE_ACCOUNT>' ]
```

## Preparation steps for demonstration
In that document, we are providing some examples of using a contract with an access control plugin. You also can explore the usage examples in the tests in `./access_controllable_base/src/lib.rs` and in `./access_control_role_base/src/lib.rs`. For running tests, please take a look at the **Test running instruction** section.

1. **Creating an account on testnet**
   For demonstration let's create 3 accounts: `<CONTRACT_ACCOUNT>`, `<ALICE_ACCOUNT>`, `<BOB_ACCOUNT>`
   ```shell
   $ near create-account <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT_NAME>.<MASTER_ACCOUNT_NAME>.testnet --masterAccount <MASTER_ACCOUNT_NAME>.testnet --initialBalance 10
   $ near create-account <ALICE_ACCOUNT_NAME>.<MASTER_ACCOUNT_NAME>.testnet --masterAccount <MASTER_ACCOUNT_NAME>.testnet --initialBalance 10
   $ near create-account <BOB_ACCOUNT_NAME>.<MASTER_ACCOUNT_NAME>.testnet --masterAccount <MASTER_ACCOUNT_NAME>.testnet --initialBalance 10
   ```

   In the next sections, we will refer to the `<CONTRACT_ACCOUNT_NAME>.<MASTER_ACCOUNT_NAME>.testnet` as `<CONTRACT_ACCOUNT>`, 
   to the `<ALICE_ACCOUNT_NAME>.<MASTER_ACCOUNT_NAME>.testnet` as `<ALICE_ACCOUNT>`, and to the `<BOB_ACCOUNT_NAME>.<MASTER_ACCOUNT_NAME>.testnet` as `<BOB_ACCOUNT>` for simplicity.

2. **Compile Contract to wasm file**
   For compiling the contract, just run the `access_controllable_base/build.sh` script. The target file with compiled contract will be `../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/access_controllable_base.wasm`

   ```shell
   $ cd access_controllable_base
   $ ./build.sh
   $ cd ..
   ```

3. **Deploy and init a contract**
   ```shell
   $ near deploy --accountId <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT> --wasmFile ../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/access_controllable_base.wasm --initFunction new --initArgs '{}'
   ```

## Example of using the contract with access control plugin
### Calling the methods with access control
For using the method, `level_a_incr` you should be a member of GroupA.  Alice is not a member of any group, so she can't use this method.

```shell
$ near call <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT> level_a_incr --accountId <ALICE_ACCOUNT>
ERROR
$ near view get_counter
0
```

Let's make Alice a member of GroupA.
```shell
$ near call <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT> acl_grant_role '{"role": "GroupA", "account_id": "<ALICE_ACCOUNT>"}' --accountId <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT>
```

Now Alice is a member of GroupA and can call the `level_a_incr` method
```shell
$ near call <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT> level_a_incr --accountId <ALICE_ACCOUNT>
$ near view get_counter
1
```

As well as calls the `level_ab_incr` method, which allowed for both GroupA and GroupB members.
```shell
$ near call <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT> level_ab_incr --accountId <ALICE_ACCOUNT>
$ near view get_counter
2
```

### Admin of the group not a member of the group
Note, the admin of the group may not be a member of this group. For example, the `<CONTRACT_ACCOUNT>` is a super admin, but he
can't execute the `level_a_incr` method. 

```shell
$ near view get_counter
2
$ near call <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT> level_a_incr --accountId <CONTRACT_ACCOUNT>
ERROR
$ near view get_counter
2
```

### Multiple super admins
There may be multiple super admins.

By default, only `acl_init_super_admin` is exposed on the contract. To add more super admins or to remove super admins, internal functions can be used.

To make this functionality publicly available, you could add functions like the following to your contract:

```rust
/// method for adding new super admin
pub fn add_super_admin(&mut self, new_super_admin_account_id: &AccountId) {
   ::near_sdk::require!(self.acl_is_super_admin(near_sdk::env::predecessor_account_id()),
                    "Method can be run only by super admin");
   self.__acl.add_super_admin_unchecked(new_super_admin_account_id);
}

/// method for removing super admin
pub fn remove_super_admin(&mut self, super_admin_account_id: &AccountId) {
   ::near_sdk::require!(self.acl_is_super_admin(near_sdk::env::predecessor_account_id()),
                    "Method can be run only by super admin");
   self.__acl.revoke_super_admin_unchecked(&super_admin_account_id);
}
```

An illustration of adding two administrators can be seen in the test `two_super_admin` in `access/contrllable_base/lib.rs`

## Tests running instruction
Tests in `access_controllable_base/src/lib.rs` contain examples of interaction with a contract.

For running test:
1. Generate `wasm` file by running `access_controllable_base/build.sh` script. The target file will be `../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/access_controllable_base.wasm`
2. Run tests `cargo test`

```shell
$ cd access_controllable_base
$ ./build.sh
$ cargo test
```

For tests, we use `workspaces` library and `sandbox` environment. For details, you can explore `../near-plugins-test-utils` crate.
